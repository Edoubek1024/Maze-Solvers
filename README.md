# Maze Solvers

Maze Solvers contains a group of python files which all utilize the pygame library to display a use of a maze. These files each show different methods of both breadth-first search and depth-first search to achieve certain goals.

## The Maze
All files in this repository use the function `new_maze` to generate a new maze. Using a square grid of cells based on a given size, a maze is generated by using depth-first search, starting at a random cell, to randomly move throughout the grid. Since this is done through depth-first search, connections to other cells are only formed if the target cell is undiscovered. Should the movement find a cell that has already been discovered or processed, it will not make a connection to it. Some of the solvers will display this lack of a connection as a wall between cells. This method allows for a complete maze without any cells that cannot be found to be created and used.
